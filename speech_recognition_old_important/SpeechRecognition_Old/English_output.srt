BEING A MILLIONAIRE MAY BE AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM FOR MOST OF US BUT WHEN WAS THE WORD FIRST USED IN ENGLISH

10
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:32,324
WAS IT A

11
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:33,589
SIXTEEN HUNDREDS

I AM GOING TO GUESS THAT IT'S THE SIXTEEN HUNDREDS

14
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:44,305
S THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,510
WELL I'LL REVEAL THE ANSWER LATER NOW THE BABY SE MONEY BOX PROGRAMME COVERS ALL SORTS OF FINANCIAL FEATURES

16
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,358
RECENTLY THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT LIFE STYLE FINANCIAL PLANNING

17
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:59,627
WHICH IS PLANNING YOUR FINANCES TO MEET THE KIND OF LIFE STYLE YOU WANT TO HAVE

18
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:03,205
JULY LAUD LEADS A FINANCIAL PLANNING ORGANIZATION

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,630
AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THE PROCESS OF LIFE STYLE FINANCIAL PLANNING

20
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:09,837
HOW MANY NUMBERS DOES SHE SAY YOU NEED TO START WITH

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,422
WHILE WE WERE START BY SAYING THAT WE NEED TO PUT TOGETHER A LIFETIME CASHFLOWORECAST OR A MODEL

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,864
OU JUST NEED FOUR NUMBERS YOUR INCOME YOUR EXPENDITURE AR SETS LIABILITIES AND THEN WE CAN PROJECT FORWARD TO SHOW YOU WHAT SORT OF LIFE STYLE YOU WILL HAVE

23
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:24,535
IF YOU DO NOTHING AT ALL

24
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:31,268
AND IF INDEED YOU DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PERHAPS AN ICE O OR A PENSION OR ANY OTHER KIND OF FINANCIAL PRODUCT MIGHT HELP YOU WITH

25
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,934
SO HOW MANY NUMBERS DO YOU NEED

26
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:37,984
SHE SAYS THAT YOU START WITH JUST FOUR NUMBERS THAT'S RIGHT

27
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:43,772
THE FIRST OF THESE NUMBERS IS YOUR INCOME THIS IS THE MONEY THAT YOU HAVE COMING IN YOUR SALARY FOR EXAMPLE

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,506
THEN THERE'S THE NUMBER FOR YOUR EXPENDITURE

29
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,717
THIS IS THE MONEY YOU HAVE GOING OUT

30
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:52,227
FOR RENT FOOD ENTERTAINMENT TRANSPORT AND SO ON

31
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,792
THE NEXT NUMBER WAS FOR ASSETS

32
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:02,925
THIS IS THE CASH VALUE OF THINGS THAT YOU OWN FOR EXAMPLE PROPERTY CARSE JULRY AS WELL AS SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS THAT KIND OF THING

33
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:09,659
AND FINALLY THERE IS LIABILITIES THIS IS THE MONEY THAT YOU OWE FOR EXAMPLE ON CREDIT CARDS OR LOANS

34
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:15,396
SO IF YOU KNOW THESE DETAILS SHE SAYS THEY CAN COME UP WITH A LIFETIME CASHFLOW ORECAST

35
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,632
WHICH IS A CALCULATION OF HOW MUCH MONEY YOU CAN EXPECT TO HAVE IN THE FUTURE

36
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,450
IF THAT IS ENOUGH TO MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS

37
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:23,952
O YOU HAVE THOSE DETAILS

38
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,420
OU KNOW YOUR NUMBERS RO

39
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,816
I HAVE A VERY DETAILED SPREAD SHEET

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,752
WHERE I DUE LIST MY INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

41
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:34,043
SO I DO KNOW FROM MONTH TO MONTH HOW MUCH MONEY I NEED

42
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:36,962
ND HOW MUCH I CAN SPEND ARE THAIT SOUNDS VERY ORGANIZED

43
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,970
DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT YOUR FUTURRE

44
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,392
WELL IT JUST REMINDS ME OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY I DON'T HAVE

45
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,265
S QUITE DEPRESSING HOW BOUT YOU KNEEL

46
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:49,872
OH I LIVE IN BLISSFUL IGNORANCE I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BIG MY DEBTS ARE

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,424
TRY NOT TO WORRY ABOUT

48
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,900
KIND OF THINK IAM MUCH TOO YOUNG TO WORRY ABOUT IT NOW

49
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:58,225
AS IF BY MAGIC IT WILL ALL WORK OUT IN THE END

50
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:01,448
SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO COME UP WITH THOSE FOUR NUMBERS

51
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,215
AND H WAINT LETS LISTEN TO JULY LORD AGAIN
