1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,790
From BBC learning English.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,090
Com Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English on nail

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,490
and I'm rub in this program with talking about finance

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,189
and in particular planning for a future Lifestyles.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,389
I can barely afford my current Lifestyle the same here,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,990
but perhaps it will pick up some good tips today

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,590
a full that though a question being a millionaire that

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,990
may be an Impossible Dream for most of us.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,090
When was the wood first used in English.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,590
Was it a the 1600s David 1700cc?

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,990
The 1800's?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,990
What do you think?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,290
Rob?

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,190
I'm going to guess that it's the 1600s as that

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,190
of always being very wealthy people.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,090
Well,

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,090
I'll reveal the sun set later.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,990
Now to BBC Money Box,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,490
program covers all sorts of financial features recently.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,290
They were talking about lifestyle financial planning,

21
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,190
which is planning your finances to make the kind of

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,690
lifestyle.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,890
You want to have Judy Lord,

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,190
leave the financial planning organization,

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,789
and she talked about the process of Lifestyle,

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,589
financial planning.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,490
How many numbers does she say?

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,789
You need to start with?

29
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,089
Well,

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,890
we would start by saying that we need to put

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,190
together a lifetime Cash Flow,

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,789
full cast,

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,390
a role model.

34
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,789
You just need phone numbers,

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,589
your income expenditure assets liabilities,

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,390
and then we can project forward to show you what

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,690
sort of Lifestyle you will have.

38
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,190
If you do nothing at all.

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,890
And if indeed you do some of the things that

40
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,289
pops and ice or a pension,

41
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,990
or any other kind of financial product might help you

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,190
with.

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,390
So,

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,789
how many numbers do you need?

45
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,390
She says that you start with just four numbers.

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,990
That's right.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,089
The first of these numbers is your income.

48
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,490
This is the money that you have coming in your

49
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,089
salary.

50
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,789
For example,

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,490
then there's the number for your expenditure.

52
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,789
This is the money you have going out for rent

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,690
food and statement to transport.

54
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,190
And so on.

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,789
The next number was for assets.

56
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,789
This is the cash value of things that you own

57
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,789
a free sample property.

58
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,289
Cause Julie is Bella savings and Investments,

59
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,990
that kind of thing.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,990
And finally,

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,589
that is liabilities.

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,090
This is the money that you owe for example,

63
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,590
on credit cards or loans.

64
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,290
So,

65
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,590
if you Play these details.

66
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,390
She says they can come up with a lifetime cash

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,390
flow forecasts,

68
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,190
which is a calculation of how much money you can

69
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,290
expect to have in the future.

70
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,790
If that is enough to meet your expectations.

71
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,990
Do you have those details?

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,390
Do you know you'll numbers rub?

73
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,990
I have a very detailed spreadsheet where I do list

74
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,790
my income and expenditure.

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,690
So I do know from month-to-month how much money I

76
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,190
need and how much I can spend all that sounds

77
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,890
very organized.

78
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,990
What does it tell you about your future?

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,490
Where?

80
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,590
It just reminds me of exactly how much money I

81
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,390
don't have quite depressing.

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,990
How about you kneel or I?

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,990
Live in Blissful ignorance?

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,890
I have no idea how big my debts are.

85
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,390
I try not to worry about it.

86
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,090
I kind of think I'm not too young to worry

87
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,590
about it.

88
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,290
Now that as if by Magic,

89
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,190
it will all work out in the end.

90
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,390
So it would be difficult for me to come up

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,390
with those phone numbers.

92
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,290
Anyway,

93
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,490
let's listen to Julie.

94
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,890
Lord,

95
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,190
again,

96
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,590
describing the lifestyle financial planning process.

97
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,790
Well,

98
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,690
we would start by saying that we need to put

99
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,290
together a lifetime Cash Flow full,

100
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,990
cast Dora mobile.

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,490
You just need phone numbers,

102
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,290
your income expenditure assets liabilities,

103
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,090
and then we can project forward to show you what

104
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,690
sort of Lifestyle you will have if you do nothing

105
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:21,990
at all.

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,590
And if indeed you do some of the things that

107
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,190
pops a nice or a pension or any other kind

108
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,290
of financial product might help you with his lifestyle financial

109
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,490
planning,

110
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,590
all the people with a good pension North Dakota to

111
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,290
Judy Lord,

112
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:44,090
but

113
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,090
with stuff these Financial product,

114
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,890
no idea.

115
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,490
Really what they are all more importantly,

116
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,690
what we going to do for us.

117
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,190
So,

118
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,990
can you give us a hand to look to help

119
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,090
us?

120
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,090
Look forward to see what will happen?

121
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,590
So she also has younger clients.

122
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,290
Who wants for her company's help.

123
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,790
Yes.

124
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,790
She uses the phrase,

125
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,090
give us a hand,

126
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,590
which means to help someone.

127
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,990
If you give someone a hug and you help them

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,590
exactly in the way that I'll give you a hand

129
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,290
with 6 Minute English.

130
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,590
Well,

131
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,790
I think I give you a hand rather than the

132
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,090
other way around.

133
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,390
Really.

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,590
Well.

135
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,490
Let's not say fool out about it.

136
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,190
Let's listen to Judy North again.

137
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,290
Well,

138
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,390
it's not a little about old age.

139
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,090
They sent me.

140
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,890
There are people that we have quite a number of

141
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,390
younger clients who come to us and say,

142
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,190
we just want to get financially organized.

143
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,490
We've heard about all this stuff.

144
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,890
These Financial product,

145
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,590
no idea.

146
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:29,790
Really,

147
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,190
what they are all more importantly,

148
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,390
what we going to do for us.

149
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,890
So,

150
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,690
can you give us a hand to look to help

151
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,790
his looks forward to see what will happen?

152
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,190
It's nearly time now,

153
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,690
to review our vocabulary,

154
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,490
but first,

155
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,790
let's have the alarm set to all quiz question.

156
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,190
When was the word millionaire first used in English?

157
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,890
Was it a,

158
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,890
the 1600 and 1700 or see the 1800's?

159
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,690
What did you think?

160
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,090
Rob would like guests and said it was the 1600s.

161
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,790
Well,

162
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,890
not a good,

163
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,590
guess this time.

164
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,390
I'm afraid that felt like it was the 1800s.

165
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,590
When it was first used in a list though.

166
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,690
It had appeared in French in the 1700 now on

167
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,290
to the vocabulary.

168
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,990
Yes.

169
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,990
We had a lot of financial terms in this program.

170
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,590
We had cash-flow forecast.

171
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,290
This is a calculation of how much money you can

172
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,890
expect to have at a particular time in the future

173
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,090
and the cash flow forecast is based on knowing your

174
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,590
income,

175
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,090
which is the money you have coming in and your

176
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,590
expenditure,

177
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,590
the money you have going out.

178
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,090
You also need to know your assets,

179
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,390
which is the value of things you own,

180
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,090
as well as savings and Investments.

181
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,590
This is balanced again.

182
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,690
Your liabilities,

183
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,990
which is the term for the money that you owe,

184
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,790
for example,

185
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,490
on credit cards.

186
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,690
And finally,

187
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,190
we have the expression to give someone a hand meaning

188
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,990
